// first way of destructuring array
var player = ["akshay","amit","vaibhav","vibhor","suraj"];
const [a,b,c,d,e] = player;
console.log(d);

//second way of destructuring array
var second = ["valentine","lobo","inves","beast","voldemort"];
let one,two,three,four,five;
[one,two,three,four,five] = second;
console.log(three);

Output:
